# Bff Strays

I decided to re-make the existing site [Bff Strays](https://bffstrays.se/) as my degree project at Medieinstitutet. Bff Strays is a non-profit organization that focuses on giving stray dogs from Spain new homes in Sweden.

## Tech stack

This project is made with Vite and I use React and typescript. The styling is mainly styled components and some scss. For code structuring I use ESLint.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

## Installation

- Clone the repository with `bash git clone`
